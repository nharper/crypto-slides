<div class="body">
<p>
<strong>Alice</strong> and <strong>Bob</strong> want to communicate with each
other so that no one else knows what they are saying. Specifically, they want
three properties:
<dl>
<dt>Confidentiality</dt>
<dd>No one apart from Alice and Bob know what is being said.</dd>
<dt>Authenticity</dt>
<dd>Alice knows that the party on the other end is Bob, and not someone else.</dd>
<dt>Integrity</dt>
<dd>When Alice (or Bob) receives a message, they know it has not been tampered with.</dd>
</dl>
<p>
<strong>Eve</strong> wants to eavesdrop on Alice and Bob's communications. Eve
can listen in on everything sent between Alice and Bob, but does not interfere
with the messages. Eve's goal is to read the plaintext of their communications.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mallory</strong>, like Eve, is also interested in Alice and Bob's
communications. In addition to listening to messages, Mallory may also intercept
messages between Alice and Bob. Mallory might change messages, create new ones,
or delay or prevent delivery of messages. However, Mallory will not create a
denial of service by blocking all messages.

<h2>Symmetric crypto: block ciphers</h2>
<div class="body">
<ul>
<li>A block cipher operates on blocks of a fixed bit length.</li>
<li>
Encryption function takes a key and a block of plaintext, and outputs a block of
ciphertext.<br>
<i>E(k, p) = c</i>
</li>
<li>
Decryption function takes a key and a block of ciphertext, and outputs a block
of plaintext.<br>
<i>D(k, c) = p</i><br>
<i>D(k, E(k, p)) = p</i>
</li>
<li>
Plaintext and ciphertext inputs must be exactly the size of the block.
</li>
<li>
Examples: AES (128-, 192-, and 256-bit blocks), 3DES (64-bit blocks), DES
(64-bit blocks)
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h2>Symmetric crypto: block ciphers</h2>
<div class="body">
<p>
Most plaintexts aren't exactly 1 block in size. To use with a block cipher,
they first need to be padded to have a length which is a multiple of the block
size.
</p>
<h3>Padding</h3>
<p>
PKCS#7 is a common form of padding, and will be used in the examples here.
Padding bytes are added to the plaintext until its length is a multiple of the
block size, and at least one padding byte is added.
</p>
<p>
For example, if the plaintext to be padded is
<input class="block" id="padding-pt" value="Hello!">
(as an ASCII string), then the resulting plaintext
<span id="padding-plural">block is</span> <span id="padding-padded"></span>.
</p>
<h3>Modes of Operation</h3>
<p>
<strong>ECB</strong> (electronic codebook) divides messages into blocks and
encrypts each one separately.
</p>
<p>
<strong>CBC</strong> (cipher block chaining) combines previous ciphertext block
with the plaintext before encrypting the next block.

<h2>Symmetric crypto: stream ciphers</h2>

<ul>
<li>
A stream cipher takes a key (and a nonce) and generates a pseudo-random
sequence.
</li>
<li>
This <em>stream</em> of bytes can be XOR'd with the plaintext to generate
ciphertext. (The ciphertext is XOR'd with the same stream to decrypt and
generate plaintext.)
</li>
<li>Examples: ChaCha20, RC4</li>
<li>
A block cipher can also be made into a stream cipher using CTR mode.

Mallory can flip bits on messages sent between Alice and Bob. Mallory can't
tell what the message is, but if Mallory knows the structure of the plaintext,
specific bits can be targeted to change the plaintext to have a different
meaning. Using a stream cipher alone, <strong>integrity</strong> is lost.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h2>Message Authentication Codes</h2>
<div class="body">
<p>
A <em>message authentication code (MAC)</em> is used to prove
<strong>integrity</strong> and <strong>authenticity</strong> of a message.
</p>
<p>The <em>sign</em> operation of a MAC takes a key and message and returns a
tag.<br>
<i>S(k, m) = t</i>
</p>
<p>The <em>verify</em> operation of a MAC takes a key, message, and tag, and
returns true iff the message and tag are not tampered with.<br>
<i>V(k, m, t) = {true, false}</i>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h2>AEADs</h2>
<div class="body">
<p>
Improperly combining encryption and MAC is an easy way to create a vulnerability
like a CBC padding oracle. See <a href="https://moxie.org/blog/the-cryptographic-doom-principle/">https://moxie.org/blog/the-cryptographic-doom-principle/</a>.
Using an AEAD combines these operations in a safer, easier-to-use operation.
</p>
<p>
An <em>AEAD (Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data)</em> combines
encryption with a MAC into a single operation. It takes four inputs, a
<i>key</i>, <i>nonce</i>, <i>plaintext</i>, and <i>associated data</i>.
The resulting ciphertext guarantees <strong>confidentiality</strong> of the
plaintext, as well as <strong>integrity</strong> of the plaintext and
associated data (<i>ad</i>). An AEAD's operations are generally depicted as
follows:
</p>
<p>
<i>Seal(key, nonce, plaintext, ad) = ciphertext</i><br>
<i>Open(key, nonce, ciphertext, ad) = plaintext OR error</i>
</p>
<p class="sad">
<img src="/images/ic_warning_white_36px.svg">
Never use a <i>(key, nonce)</i> pair more than once.
</p>
<p>

<p>Examples: AES-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305</p>

<div class="slide ab">
<div class="ab-header">
<img class="ab-icon" src="/images/ic_account_box_white_48px.svg">
<p>
Alice and Bob use an AEAD, and keep count of how many messages they've
sent/received, putting that value in the <i>associated data</i>.

</div>
<div class="body">
<p class="happy">
<img src="/images/ic_mood_white_36px.svg">
If Mallory tries to replay a message, the receiving party will have a
different count, causing the AEAD to fail to open. Without knowing Alice and
Bob's key, there's not much Mallory can do to disrupt them besides a denial
of service.
</p>
<p class="sad">
<img src="/images/ic_mood_bad_white_36px.svg">
If Alice or Bob lose control of their shared key and Eve or Mallory get ahold
of it, then there's trouble. If Eve recorded traffic between Alice and Bob, Eve
can now decrypt that traffic (and future traffic). Mallory can do the same, and
Mallory can also forge messages in the future.

<h2>Asymmetric crypto</h2>
<div class="body">
<p>What if Alice and Bob can't meet out-of-band to exchange a secret?</p>

<div class="slide">
<h2>Diffie-Hellman key exchange</h2>
<div class="body">
<p>
<em>Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange</em> is a method for two parties to agree
on a shared secret without an eavesdropper finding out that secret.
</p>
<p>
Each party computes a public and private value, and sends their public value to
the other. When both parties do a computation with their private value and the
other's public value, they end up at the same value.
</p>
<p>
An eavesdropper who only sees these public values can't do a computation to
arrive at that same value.
<p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h2>Diffie-Hellman Math: Group Theory</h2>
<div class="body">
<p>
A <em>group</em> is a structure containing a set of elements and a binary
operator on those elements. A set <i>G</i> and operator <i>&#x2218;</i> is a
group if it satisfies the following properties:
</p>
<ul>
<li>For all <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> in <i>G</i>, <i>a &#x2218; b</i> must also be in <i>G</i>.</li>
<li>
For all <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>c</i> in <i>G</i>,
<i>(a &#x2218; b) &#x2218; c = a &#x2218; (b &#x2218; c)</i>.
</li>
<li>
There exists <i>i</i> in <i>G</i> such that for every <i>a</i> in <i>G</i>,
<i>i &#x2218; a = a &#x2218; i = a</i>.
</li>
<li>
For each <i>a</i> in <i>G</i>, there exists <i>b</i> in <i>G</i> such that
<i>a &#x2218; b = b &#x2218; a = i</i>.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
A <em>cyclic group</em> is a group that can be created from a single generator
element <i>g</i> in <i>G</i>. That is, by applying <i>g</i> successively it
generates every element in the group.
</p>
<p>
The <em>order</em> of a cyclic group is the number of times the generator
<i>g</i> must be applied to get back to the identity <i>i</i>.
</p>
</div>
<div class="notes">
<p>
Example: Integers under addition mod 4
</p>
<p>
The set of elements is {0, 1, 2, 3} and the operation &#x2218; is + (mod 4). The
identity <i>i</i> is 0, and a generator <i>g</i> is 1. Successive applications
of the generator <i>g</i> generate all elements in the set. Zero applications
gives us 0, one application is just <i>g</i>, 1+1 = 2, 1+1+1 = 3, and 1+1+1+1 =
0 (mod 4).
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h2>Diffie-Hellman Math</h2>
<div class="body">
<p>
Diffie-Hellman is done on a cyclic group. Let's assume that a group has been
chosen with generator <i>g</i> and order <i>n</i>. Diffie-Hellman works by
doing the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Alice picks a random integer <i>a &lt; n</i>, and Bob picks a random integer
<i>b &lt; n</i>. <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are private values.
</li>
<li>
Alice computes <i>g<sup>a</sup></i>, that is <i>g</i> applied to itself <i>a</i>
times, and sends it to Bob. Bob does similarly - computing <i>g<sup>b</sup></i>
and sending it to Alice.
</li>
<li>
Alice takes <i>g<sup>b</sup></i> from Bob and computes
<i>(g<sup>b</sup>)<sup>a</sup></i>. Likewise, Bob computes
<i>(g<sup>a</sup>)<sup>b</sup></i>. This is the shared secret.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h2>Diffie-Hellman</h2>
<div class="body">
<p>
(Finite field) Diffie-Hellman uses integers under multiplication mod
<i>p</i> (where <i>p</i> is some prime). The generator <i>g</i> is a
primitive root (mod <i>p</i>).
</p>
<p>
Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) uses points on an elliptic curve as
the set for the group, with the generator <i>g</i> being the base point of
the curve, and the operation is EC point addition. (When a curve like P-256 is
specified, all of those parameters are encapsulated in the P-256 specification.)
</p>
<p>
The security of Diffie-Hellman relies on it being a hard problem to compute
<i>a</i> from <i>g<sup>a</sup></i> for that group. For Finite field DH, this is
the <q>discrete logarithm</q> problem; for ECDH it is known as the
<q>elliptic curve discrete logarithm</q> problem.
</p>
<p>
Diffie-Hellman can be done on other groups. Using a supersingular isogeny group
is one proposal for post-quantum key exchange. Other non-DH post-quantum key
exchange algorithms also exist.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h2>Key Derivation Functions</h2>
<div class="body">
<p>
A <em>key derivation function</em> takes some input (like the shared secret from
DH) and outputs a value suitable to use as a crypto key while retaining the
entropy from the input.
</p>
<p>
The shared secret from DH can have some structure to it (depending on the
group that was used), and an attacker with knowledge of this structure might
be able to gain an advantage from that knowledge if the shared DH secret is
used directly as a symmetric key.
</p>
<p>
A KDF is also useful for deriving multiple keys from the same secret.

Mallory can man-in-the-middle the connection between Alice and Bob, so that
Alice does DH with Mallory (instead of Bob), and Bob does DH with Mallory
(instead of Alice). Mallory now has a key for each of Alice and Bob, and passes
messages between (possibly changing them if Mallory feels so inclined). Each
of Alice and Bob think they're talking to the other when they're really talking
to Mallory.
</p>
<p>
Although this scheme provides <strong>confidentiality</strong> and
<strong>integrity</strong>, neither Alice nor Bob really know who's on the
other end (it could be Mallory instead), so it lacks
<strong>authenticity</strong>.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h2>RSA Encryption</h2>
<div class="body">
<p>
Symmetric crypto uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt. With RSA, a public
key is used to encrypt, and a private key is used to decrypt.
</p>
<h3>Generating a key</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Pick random primes <i>p</i> and <i>q</i> so their product <i>n = pq</i> is
of the desired bit length.
</li>
<li>
Choose a public exponent <i>e</i>. Common choices are 3 or 65537.
</li>
<li>
Calculate the private exponent <i>d</i> using knowledge of <i>p</i> and
<i>q</i> so that for all <i>m &lt; n</i>,
<i>(m<sup>e</sup>)<sup>d</sup> = m </i>(mod <i>n</i>).
</li>
<li>
The values <i>n</i> and <i>e</i> form the public key, while <i>d</i> is part
of the private key.
</ul>
<h3>Encrypting/decrypting</h3>
<p>
Assuming the message to encrypt is <i>m</i> and the encrypted ciphertext is
<i>c</i>, the following formulas are used to encrypt/decrypt:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Encryption: <i>c = m<sup>e</sup> </i>(mod <i>n</i>)</li>
<li>Decryption: <i>m = c<sup>d</sup> </i>(mod <i>n</i>)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="notes">
<ul>
<li>Only values less than n can be encrypted/decrypted</li>
<li>
If the exponent and message are small, the resulting ciphertext might not do
the modulus wrap-around. In this case, computing the root is very easy to
recover the message from the ciphertext.
</li>
<li>
In practice, raw RSA isn't used - instead it is used with padding. Some padding
schemes (PKCS1v1.5) have pitfalls. Padding avoids the small message problem,
but can introduce other problems. Recommend using RSASSA-OAEP.
<ul>
<li>PKCS1v1.5 padding is 0x00 0x02 (any non-zero bytes) 0x00 message.</li>
<li>
OAEP uses a mask generation function (MGF1 is the only one defined), which
uses a hash function and deterministically turns input into desired length.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
To encrypt something larger than n, one encrypts a symmetric key with RSA, and
sends the content under symmetric encryption.
</li>
</ul>

<div class="slide">
<h2>RSA Signing</h2>
<div class="body">
<p>
A private key is used to sign a message, and anyone with the public key can
verify.
</p>
<p>
The same method for generating encryption keys can be used for generating
signing keys. Again, <i>n</i> and <i>e</i> form the public key, while <i>d</i>
is part of the private key. <i>m</i> is the message to sign, and <i>s</i> is
the signature of the message.
<ul>
<li>Sign: <i>s = m<sup>d</sup> </i>(mod <i>n</i>)</li>
<li>
Verify: compute <i>s<sup>e</sup> </i>(mod <i>n</i>) and return true iff it
equals <i>m</i>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is encryption/decryption with <i>e</i> and <i>d</i> reversed. This makes
sense: with RSA encryption anyone can encrypt but only the private key holder
can decrypt; signing is opposite where only the private key holder can sign
but anyone can verify.
